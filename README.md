## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Linux** Linux with PulseAudio or PipeWire (with pipewire-pulse)
- **Python 3.7+**
- **PulseAudio** daemon running

### Installation

#### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lukuoris/wave-reborn.git
cd wave-reborn

# Run the launcher (auto-installs everything)
python start.py
```

That's it! On first run, the application will:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install all dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn, PyQt5)
3. **Offer to install to your application menu** (recommended!)
4. Start the backend server
5. Open your browser to the mixer interface

The installer will ask if you want to add Wave Reborn to your system menu - just press **Y** for convenient access from your application launcher!

#### Manual System Integration

If you skipped the installation during first run, you can install manually:

```bash
# Run the installation script
./install.sh
```

This will:
- Add Wave Reborn to your application launcher/menu
- Install the application icon
- Make it accessible from all desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)

**To uninstall:**
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

### Alternative: System Tray Mode (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies first
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with system tray integration
./run_tray.sh
# or
python tray_app.py
```

**Tray Menu Features:**
- 🌐 **Open Mixer** - Launch web interface
- ⚙️ **Settings** - Configure audio and network
- 🔄 **Restart Backend** - Apply changes
- ❌ **Quit** - Clean shutdown

### Autostart Configuration

Enable Wave Reborn to start automatically on login:

1. Open **⚙️ Settings** in the web interface
2. Navigate to **🚀 Application Settings**
3. Toggle **Autostart on Login**

Or manually:
```bash
# The autostart file will be created at:
# ~/.config/autostart/wave-reborn.desktop
```

## 🎛️ Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

<div align="center">

**Main Mixer Interface**

1. **Vertical Faders** - Control volume levels
   - **Monitor** (left) - What you hear in headphones
   - **Stream** (right) - What OBS/stream captures
2. **VU Meters** - Real-time audio level visualization
3. **Mute Buttons** - Quickly silence channels
4. **Application Routing** - Route any app to any channel

**Settings Panel**

- 🎧 **Audio Configuration** - Select output device, adjust latency
- 📻 **Channel Management** - Add, remove, rename channels
- 🌐 **Network Settings** - Configure ports and host binding
- 🚀 **Application Settings** - Enable/disable autostart on login

</div>

### Desktop GUI (Qt5)

```bash
python wavepipe.py
```

Traditional desktop interface with:
- Horizontal sliders for volume control
- Device selection dropdown
- Quick preset toggles
- Native system integration

### Backend Only Mode

```bash
python run_wavepipe.py
```

Runs backend without separate frontend server (access via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Web-based Configuration (Easy)

1. Click **⚙️ Settings** in the web interface
2. Select your audio device from the dropdown
3. Customize channels, latency, and network settings
4. Click **Save Settings**
5. Restart the application

### Command-line Configuration

```bash
python configure.py
```

Interactive menu for:
- Audio device selection (auto-detected)
- Channel customization
- Latency adjustment
- Port configuration

### Manual Configuration

Edit `wave_config.json` (auto-generated on first run):

```json
{
  "audio": {
    "output_device": "alsa_output.usb-AudioDevice-analog-stereo",
    "channels": ["Music", "Game", "Voice", "System"],
    "latency_ms": 20
  },
  "network": {
    "backend_port": 8000,
    "frontend_port": 8080,
    "backend_host": "127.0.0.1"
  }
}
```

**Find your audio device:**
```bash
pactl list short sinks
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

Backend runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default.

### REST API

| Endpoint | Method | Parameters | Description |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| `/channels` | GET | - | Get all channels state |
| `/set_volume_stream` | POST | `channel`, `value` | Set stream volume (0-100) |
| `/set_volume_you` | POST | `channel`, `value` | Set monitor volume (0-100) |
| `/mute` | POST | `channel` | Mute channel |
| `/unmute` | POST | `channel` | Unmute channel |
| `/applications` | GET | - | List all audio applications |
| `/route_application` | POST | `app_index`, `channel` | Route app to channel |
| `/config` | GET | - | Get current configuration |
| `/config` | POST | `config` (JSON) | Save configuration |
| `/config/reset` | POST | - | Reset to defaults |
| `/config/devices` | GET | - | List audio devices |

### WebSocket

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/vu` | Real-time VU meter data stream (~20 FPS) |

**Example WebSocket Usage:**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:8000/vu');
ws.onmessage = (e) => {
  const levels = JSON.parse(e.data);
  // levels = { "Music": 0.75, "Game": 0.4, ... }
};
```

## 🎮 Application Routing

### Via Web Interface
1. Navigate to **Application Routing** section
2. Click **Refresh Applications** to scan for audio apps
3. Select target channel from dropdown for each application
4. Routes instantly - no restart required

### Via Command Line
```bash
# List all applications with their sink-input IDs
pactl list sink-inputs

# Route application to a channel
pactl move-sink-input <sink-input-id> <channel>_Apps

# Example: Route Firefox to Music channel
pactl move-sink-input 42 Music_Apps
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Applications not routing to channels (stuck on EasyEffects)</b></summary>

If you're using **EasyEffects** and applications won't stay on Wave Reborn channels after routing them:

**Solution:**
1. Open EasyEffects
2. Go to the **"Applications"** tab (or "Inputs" section)
3. Find your application in the list (game, browser, etc.)
4. Click on the application
5. Enable the **"Exclude"** or **"Bypass"** option for that application

This tells EasyEffects to stop intercepting audio from that specific application, allowing Wave Reborn to control its routing instead.

**Alternative:** If you don't need EasyEffects processing for certain apps, you can close EasyEffects before launching them, then route them to Wave Reborn channels.

**Note:** This is a known limitation when using Wave Reborn alongside EasyEffects, as both tools compete for audio routing control.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>No audio devices found</b></summary>

```bash
# Check if PulseAudio is running
systemctl --user status pulseaudio

# Start PulseAudio if not running
systemctl --user start pulseaudio

# Restart PulseAudio if needed
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio

# Verify devices are detected
pactl list short sinks
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>pactl command not found</b></summary>

Install PulseAudio utilities:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils

# Fedora
sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S pulseaudio

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install pulseaudio-utils
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Backend won't start - Port already in use</b></summary>

```bash
# Check what's using port 8000
lsof -i :8000

# Kill the process or change port
python configure.py
# Then select different port in network settings
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Channels disappear after reboot</b></summary>

Wave Reborn channels are temporary and cleared on restart. This is by design.

**Solutions:**
1. Use system tray mode - starts automatically when you log in
2. Add to startup applications:
   ```bash
   # Add this to your autostart
   /path/to/wave-reborn/run_tray.sh
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Audio quality issues / crackling</b></summary>

Adjust latency in settings:

1. Open **⚙️ Settings**
2. Increase **Audio Latency** (try 30-50ms)
3. Save and restart

Higher latency = better stability, lower latency = less delay.
